# Martin Altamar - Data Analysis Portfolio
## About

Hi, I´m Martin!, industrial engineer from colombia, i have 3 years of experience in supply chain management, inventory and data analysis, and it was in this last role where i truly found something i love doing.

You´ll see, i´ve always been curious and as a tech nerd i began to study everything related to data science and i found a profound interest on how finding the right insights can have such a big impact in any business, i see it as how sherlock holmes digs into a mistery looking for ways to connect the dots to find the neccesary insights that can make him take the right desitions and solve the mistery.:shipit:

_So...desitions huh_

Desitions lead our way and the way of any business, for this reason i became a business intelligence specialist, to be able purge the data, connect the dots and create a path to move forward safely, but to do this, technical skills are needed and this is my humble repository to showcase my skills, projects, and my journey to become a master in data sciences.

**Come!, JOIN ME! and check what i´ve been doing over here.**
