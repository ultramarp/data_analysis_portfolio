Data Analysis Portfolio

About
Hi, I´m Martin!, industrial engineer from colombia, i have 3 years of experience in supply chain management, inventory and data analysis, and it was in this last role where i truly found something i love doing.
You´ll see, i´ve always been curious and as a tech nerd i began to study everything related to data science and i found a profound interest on how finding the right insights can have such a big impact in any business, i see it as how sherlock holmes digs into a mistery looking for ways to connect the dots to find the correct insight that can make him take the right desitions and solve the mistery.

So...desitions huh

Desitions lead our way and the way of any business, for this reason i became a business intelligence specialist, to be able purge the data, connect the dots and create a path to move forward safely, but to do this, technical skills are needed and this is my humble repository to showcase my skills, projects, and my journey to becoming a master in data sciences.

Come!, JOIN ME! and check what i´ve been doing over here.
