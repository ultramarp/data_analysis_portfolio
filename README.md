# Martin Altamar - Data Analysis Portfolio
## About

Hi, I´m Martin!, industrial engineer from colombia, i have 3 years of experience in data analysis, supply chain management and inventory and it was in my data analyst  role where i truly found something i enjoy doing.

You´ll see, i´ve always been curious about why things happen and the reasons behind them, so as a tech nerd i began to study everything related to data science and i found a profound interest on how finding the right insights can have such a big impact on any business, i see it like how sherlock holmes digs into a mistery looking for ways to connect the dots to find the neccesary data that can make him take the right desitions and solve the mistery.:shipit:

_...desitions huh_

Desitions lead our way and the way of any business and that is why i decided to go in all the way in the data world and after a year became a business intelligence specialist and start developing my knowledge to be able purge the data, connect the dots and create a path to move forward safely, but to do this, technical skills are needed and this is my humble repository to showcase my skills, projects, and my journey to become a master in data science.

**Come!, JOIN ME! and check what i´ve been doing over here.**
